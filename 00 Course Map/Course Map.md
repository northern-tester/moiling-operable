# Improving Testing Through Better Operability

## Course Title

Improving Your Testing Through Better Operability

Hopefully the title resonates for the primary audience (testers) and through the course I can show that although the focus might be on better testing, operability enhancements are cool for everyone. 

## Target Learners

* Who is this course for?
  * My primary thought is that it is for testers, specifically those who are in teams transitioning to looking after their own platforms or maybe creating a new platform. 
  * I get asked often by testers what their roles might be in 'DevOps' and operability creates a useful focus.
* What problems are they facing?
  * I think they are faced by a request/need for them to get involved in testing new platforms, disposable environments, cloud based systems but without the fundamentals of operability.
  * Also, I think often without the technical know how to get involved, plus there can be a lingering resistance from operations teams to let testers get involved, alas you still have to prove yourself often.
  * As testers are often (in my experience) not involved in operability changes, they miss opportunities to enhance their testing skills and over testability of the system.
* What skills are they developing?
  * There are two threads to this:

    | Mindset | Technology |
    |---|---|
    |Wider operational teams over development teams only| Networking concepts such as DNS, proxies,protocols|
    |Focus on system usage over testing functionality| Monitoring, logging, events and metrics|
    |System wide failure over feature failure| Testing hooks for failover, disaster recovery, data loss, deployment strategies|
    |Focus on production over test environments|Resource modelling, storage, compute, databases, support models| 

* What is their knowledge gap?
  * I think the gap comes from testing what you can see (as in a feature) to the metadata of a system, around capacity, deployment, operational team roles, monitoring, modelling usage.
  * The course will look to enumerate what characteristics an operable system has, approaches to testing for them, finally how they improve testing in general.
  
## Prerequisite course, knowledge, skills or tools

* What knowledge or skill set do learners need to have before starting your course?
  * Three aspects to this I think
    * Expose to solution architecture - able to describe some of the patterns of an architecture (layered, client server, model-view-controller)
    * Knowledge of deployment patterns and source control - such as canary/feature toggles, plus tooling like Jenkins as a common starting point.  
* Are there any existing courses on the Dojo that they should complete first?
  * The 'Building Blocks of the Internet' would be a good start, as a lot of the concepts are testing the overall system and its interactions. Anything of an architectural nature.
* Are there any tools or programmes they are required to use?
  * Docker/Docker compose for general setup, mostly just for ease/speed of use
  * Jenkins for deployment based sessions
  * Git as a source control tool, mostly pull, rather than push

## Course Goals

* What skills and/or knowledge will learners walk away with or develop?
* What problems they will be able to solve?

## Course Description

Sell your course to your target learners, be enthusiastic and let them know the purpose of this course, what’ll they’ll learn and the awesome benefits completing this course will bring to their lives

## Lesson Plan

* Write a clear title telling learning what each lesson will cover
* What key knowledge or skills will your learners walk away with from each lesson?
* Are you learners ready for each lesson? Note down the prior knowledge required to complete each lesson, was this covered in the lesson before?
